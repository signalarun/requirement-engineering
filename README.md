# Requirement engineering
  
  It is a four step process that includes 
  
    1. Feasibility Study  
    2. Requirement Elicitation and Analysis  
    3. Software Requirement Specification  
    4. Software Requirement Validation  
    5. Software Requirement Management

## Requirement gathering techniques
 1. Brainstorming
 2. Focus Group
 3. Interview
 4. Prototyping
 5. Reverse engineering
 
  ```
    Take care of Non-functional requirements, dependency requirements, confirm and get input from all stakeholders
  ```

## Requirement classification
 1. Classified based upon criticality
 2. Classified based on a rationale (why?)
 3. Finding key driving requirement, i.e. a reuirement that introduces other requirement
 4. Prioritization of the requirement (importance)
